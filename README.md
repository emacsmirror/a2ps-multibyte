# a2ps-multibyte.el

This package allows printing Emacs buffers using `a2ps`, even when they use an UTF-8 charset or
another multibyte character coding system (such encodings are otherwise not supported by `a2ps`).

This only works if the buffer contents could have been encoded using a supported 8-bit coding system
(e.g. a French text stored as UTF-8, but featuring only ISO-8859-15 characters).


## Installation

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/a2ps-multibyte-package")
(require 'a2ps-multibyte)
```

You can optionally bind the `a2ps` commands to keys:

```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<print>")   'a2ps-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "S-<print>") 'a2ps-region)
```


## Basic usage

`a2ps-multibyte` reimplements the same commands as the Emacs' standard `a2ps` package. You can thus
use the usual interface:

- `M-x a2ps-buffer`
- `M-x a2ps-region`

Giving these commands a prefix argument allows specifying additional switches to be used in the
`a2ps` command line.

If all characters in the buffer/region cannot be coded using the coding system specified by
`a2ps-encoding`, you will be proposed to provide another.


## Customization

This package can be customized _via_ Emacs' standard interface: `M-x customize-group a2ps`

Here are the relevant variables:

- `a2ps-command`: path to the `a2ps` utility.
- `a2ps-switches`: list of additional command-line switches, e.g.

   ```lisp
   (setq a2ps-switches '("-l" "100"))
   ```

- `a2ps-encoding`: 8-bit encoding to try by default when printing files. If you mostly work with
  documents in a language supported by an 8-bit encoding, this is the one you should specify
  here. E.g.

  ```lisp
  (setq a2ps-encoding 'iso-8859-15-unix) ;; Latin-1 charset
  ```

  Try running `M-x list-coding-systems` to see the full list of supported encodings.
