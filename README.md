# `a2ps-multibyte`

This package allows printing Emacs buffers using `a2ps`, even when they use an UTF-8
charset or another multibyte character coding system (such encodings are otherwise not
supported by `a2ps`).

This only works if the buffer contents could have been encoded using another supported
coding system (e.g. a French text stored as UTF-8, but featuring only ISO-8859-15
characters).


## Installation

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/a2ps-multibyte-package")
(require 'a2ps-multibyte)
```
    
You can optionally bind the `a2ps` commands to keys:

```elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<print>")   'a2ps-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "S-<print>") 'a2ps-region)
```


## Basic usage

`a2ps-multibyte` reimplements the same commands as the Emacs' standard `a2ps` package. You
can thus use the usual interface:

- `M-x a2ps-buffer`
- `M-x a2ps-region`

Giving these commands a prefix argument allows specifying additional switches to be used
in the `a2ps` command line.


## Customization

The relevant variables are:

- `a2ps-command`: path to the `a2ps` utility.
- `a2ps-switches`: list of additional command-line switches, e.g.

   ```elisp
   (setq a2ps-switches '("-l" "100"))
   ```
